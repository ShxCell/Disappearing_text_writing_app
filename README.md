**GUI PROJECT - DISAPPEARING TEXT WRITING APP**

This project is a part of my personal portofolio project tasked in "100 Days of Code: A Complete Python Pro Bootcamp". This app is one of the tools for those who can't think to write. This app forces you to write anything by oogling the ideas. If you stop, your progress will be lost. I made it using simple tkinter module in python.

If you want to try my app, you can download DissText_App.exe in "Dist". I converted it into executable files using pyinstaller 5.13.2 . This latest version of pyinstaller (6.8.0) triggers the windows defender.
